# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is a unified cross-platform package management system (think "better Topgrade") combined with dotfiles management. It provides a single interface to manage packages across multiple package managers while also handling system configuration through GNU Stow.

## Key Architecture

### Directory Structure
- **Reorganized config structure** (as of 2024-07):
  - `configs/common/` - Cross-platform configurations
  - `configs/osx_only/` - macOS-specific configurations
  - `configs/windows_only/` - Windows-specific configurations
  - `configs/linux_only/` - Linux-specific configurations
- **Setup scripts**: `setup_*` directories contain platform-specific installation and configuration scripts
- **System maintenance**: `sys_maintenance_*` directories contain Just files for automated system upkeep
- **Tools**: `tools/` directory contains utilities like health check and package management

### Configuration Management
- Uses **GNU Stow** for symlinking dotfiles to home directory
- Each config directory has its own `.stowrc` with `--dotfiles` and `--no-folding` flags
- Configurations are organized by application/tool in separate directories
- Multiple Emacs configurations supported via Chemacs 2 (Doom, Spacemacs, custom)

### Unified Package Management
- **Single interface** for multiple package managers per platform:
  - **macOS**: brew/cask + mas (Mac App Store) + npm/pip/gem
  - **Arch Linux**: pacman + AUR (via yay) + npm/pip/gem  
  - **Ubuntu**: apt + npm/pip/gem
  - **Windows**: scoop + chocolatey + MSYS2/pacman
- **Future**: App-specific managers (zinit, elpaca, lazy.nvim, cargo, pipx)
- **Two-step updates**: `just update-check` â†’ `just update-upgrade`

## Common Commands

### System Maintenance (using Just)
```bash
# From project root (new environment-driven approach):
just stow                  # Stow configurations based on .dotfiles.env
just check-health          # Run health check on system
just cleanup-broken-links  # Find broken symlinks (dry run)
just cleanup-broken-links-remove  # Remove broken symlinks

# Navigate to system maintenance directory for updates:
just goto-sys-maintenance

# In sys_maintenance directory:
just system-check          # Preview all available updates
just system-upgrade        # Weekly fast update (brew, mas, completions)
just system-maintain       # Monthly deep maintenance
just brew-upgrade          # Update Homebrew packages
just mas-upgrade          # Update Mac App Store apps (macOS)
```

### Docker Testing Commands (Tiered Approach)
```bash
# CURRENT (working but outdated terminology):
cd test && just test-update basic arch   # Test complete workflow
cd test && just test-run basic arch      # Interactive shell

# PLANNED (tiered testing reflecting real usage patterns):
just test-min-cli arch     # Minimal CLI tools only
just test-mid-cli ubuntu   # Extended CLI tools  
just test-mid-dev arch     # Development environment (multi-PM testing begins)
just test-max-dev ubuntu   # Full development (comprehensive multi-PM validation)

# GUI tiers tested manually only (no Docker)
```

### Dotfile Management
```bash
# New approach - from project root:
just stow                  # Automatically stows based on .dotfiles.env settings

# Manual stowing (from within config directories):
cd configs/common
stow git git_my shell tmux vim wezterm spelling

# Platform-specific configs (macOS example):
cd ../osx_only
stow git_osx shell_osx alacritty_osx hammerspoon

# Remove symlinks
stow -D <package_name>

# Note: Each directory has .stowrc with --dotfiles and --no-folding flags
```

### Package Manager Operations
```bash
# Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew bundle dump                    # Export current packages to Brewfile
brew bundle --file=./Brewfile      # Install from Brewfile

# Scoop (Windows)
scoop export > packages.json       # Export package list
scoop install packages.json        # Install from export
```

### Git Submodules
```bash
# Initialize after cloning
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Development Environment Setup

### Primary Editor: Emacs
- Multiple configurations via Chemacs 2: Doom Emacs (primary), Spacemacs, custom
- Doom Emacs health check: `doom doctor`
- Configuration locations:
  - Doom: `~/.emacs.doom/`
  - Custom: `~/.emacs.default/`
  - Chemacs profiles: `~/.emacs-profiles.el`

### Terminal Setup
- Primary terminal: WezTerm (cross-platform)
- Shell: Zsh with custom configurations
- Multiplexer: tmux with custom themes and plugin management
- Color support: 24-bit true color configured via terminfo

### Language Support
- Python: pyenv + pip for global packages
- Node.js: npm for global packages
- Ruby: rbenv + gem

## Important Files

### Configuration Files
- `README.org`: Comprehensive setup instructions for all platforms
- `TODO.org`: Current tasks and ongoing work
- `.dotfiles.env`: Environment variables for configuration (e.g., DOTFILES_CLI_EDITORS=true)
- Shell configs: `configs/common/shell/dot-zshrc`, `configs/common/shell/dot-shell_common`
- Git configs: `configs/common/git/dot-common.gitconfig`, `configs/*/git_*/dot-gitconfig` (platform-specific)
- Tmux: `configs/common/tmux/dot-tmux.conf` with theme system
- Editor configs: `configs/common/emacs/dot-doom.d/`, `configs/common/nvim/dot-config/nvim-*/`

### System Maintenance
- Main justfile: `justfile` (project root)
- Platform-specific: `sys_maintenance_*/dot-sys_maintenance/justfile`
- Package management: `tools/package-management/` with TOML definitions
- Health check: `tools/dotfiles-health/dotfiles-health.sh`

## Special Considerations

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Path handling varies between platforms (Windows vs Unix)
- Package names may differ between package managers
- Some tools require platform-specific configurations (e.g., Karabiner on macOS, AutoHotkey on Windows)

### Security
- Email configurations use system keychain for password storage
- GPG configurations are platform-specific
- SSH configurations follow platform conventions

### Performance
- ZSH completions require proper permissions (use `compaudit` to check)
- Emacs uses native compilation where available
- Terminal color support configured for performance

## Current Implementation Status (2025-07-29)

### Recently Completed
- âœ… Major dotfiles reorganization (common/, osx_only/, linux_only/, windows_only/)
- âœ… Environment-driven architecture with .dotfiles.env configuration
- âœ… Fixed all 13 git submodules after reorganization
- âœ… Updated README.org with tiered configuration approach
- âœ… Documentation positioned as "better Topgrade" unified package management

### Planned Implementation (High Priority)
- ðŸ”„ Rename `_ADVANCED` â†’ `_HEAVY` throughout system
- ðŸ”„ Implement `IS_PERSONAL_MACHINE` and `IS_WORK_MACHINE` context flags
- ðŸ”„ Create tiered test recipes (test-min-cli, test-mid-dev, etc.)
- ðŸ”„ Fix test justfile path inconsistencies and remove broken recipes
- ðŸ”„ Ensure mid-dev and max-dev tiers test multiple package managers (AUR on Arch)

### Future Vision
- App-specific package managers (zinit, elpaca, lazy.nvim)
- Complete unified package management across all package managers
- True multi-package-manager coordination and conflict resolution

## Workflow Notes

When making changes:
1. Test configurations on relevant platforms using tiered approach
2. Update TOML package definitions when adding new tools
3. Consider both GUI and terminal environments
4. Maintain backward compatibility where possible
5. Use unified package commands rather than individual package managers
6. Test multi-package-manager scenarios in mid-dev and max-dev tiers
