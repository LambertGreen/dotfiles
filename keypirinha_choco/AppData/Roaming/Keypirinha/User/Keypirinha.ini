# Update 1:
# Using Ctrl+Alt key as "leader" key for OS level interactions so that
# Ctrl, and Alt individually can be kept for application level usage e.g.
# They are heavily used by Emacs.
# Note: I did try using Win key as "leader" but unfortunately MS has hardcoded
# some shortcuts on that key already, that are not easily modified.
# It may be possible to workaround it using AutoHotKey, but in that case we
# would still be binding the Win key combo in AutoHotKey to what is
# configured here i.e. it would not change below config.
#
# Update 2:
# Using Ctrl+Space because it is simpler.  Will update Emacs and other apps
# accordingly. The leader key for the editor is "Space" so there is no need
# for there to be a conflict.
