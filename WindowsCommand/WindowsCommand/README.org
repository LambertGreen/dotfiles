#+title: WindowsCommand configuration


* Introduction
Configuration for the =CMD.exe= shell.

The =CMD= shell is quite anti-quadated but we still need to use it from time to time. It does load much faster than =Powershell=, and with help of =Clink= and =GNU= tools for =Windows=, it is a more familiar environment to the =POSIX= shells.

* Initialization
The ~"./dev.cmd"~ is used to startup a better =CMD= environment by doing the following:
1. Load =clink=
2. Runs the ~"./dev_profile.cmd"~ file
3. Runs =doskey= to setup useful aliases defined in ~"./doskey_macros.txt"~

* Clink
The =clink= settings are defined in ~"~/dev/my/dotfiles/clink"~

* Aliases
Aliases are set using =doskey= in ~"./doskey_macros.txt"~.

We use aliases to have some consistency across platforms, and to use more modern versions of common tools (e.g. tools implemented in =rust=):
1. ~ls~ aliases for directory listing (using ~exa~)
2. ~cat~ (using ~bat~)
3. ~g~ for ~git~

* Shell Scripts
Usefull shell scripts start with prefix ~lgreen_~ e.g.:
1. switching between light/dark mode


* TODOs [0/0]
** TODO Complete light-dark-mode support [0/2]
*** [ ] Enable getting current ~COLOR-MODE~
*** [ ] Enable setting the current ~COLOR-MODE~
