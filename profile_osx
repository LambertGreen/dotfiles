# Note: using Homebrew very carefully e.g.
# only installing very popular and useful utilities
# and not installing anything that requests elevated

# Note: I have tried for a second time to use brew installed
# into a home local directory. This works fine for just
# applications, but it's a problem when one needs to
# install libraries e.g. trying to build something
# that needs an include file for a library installed
# via brew.
