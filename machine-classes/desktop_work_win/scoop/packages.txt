# cygwin - REMOVED: Already installed on work machine + we use MSYS2.
#          Risk: Multiple Unix environments cause PATH conflicts and tool confusion.
#          Note: MSYS2 provides better Windows integration than Cygwin for our use case.

# python39 - REMOVED: Work machine already has Python installed.
#           Risk: Installing different Python version could break work workflows.
#           TODO: Future improvement - detect existing Python and only install if missing,
#           or use virtual environments to avoid conflicts with work setup.
#           Priority: Work stability > latest Python features
