# Admin-level packages for Docker testing
# In Docker these won't actually prompt for password, but we can test the logic

# Simulated admin packages (in real systems these might need privileges)
# Using simpler packages that will actually install in Docker
brew "htop"    # System monitoring tool (sometimes requires admin)
brew "ncdu"    # Disk usage analyzer (sometimes requires admin for system dirs)
